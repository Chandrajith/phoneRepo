## Introduction
   One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

## Raw Data
Here are the data for the project: 

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

The rest of this document covers the variables, the data, and all transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

## Transformations
### First, the data download is specified via R in the attached script - run_analysis.R


```r
  fileUrl  <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip"
  download.file(fileUrl, destfile = "samsung.zip", method = "curl")
  unzip("samsung.zip")
```
### Second, the files are loaded into R

Note
- The X_train.txt contains the training data
- The Y_train.txt contains the corresponding label

### Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data se
### Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names
#### i.e Filter anything other than std or mean
###  Mmerge test and training sets into one data set
  - Uses cbind to combine columns of test and train data
  - [Data], [Activity]  => [Data, Activity]
  - cbind again to make [Data, Label, Activity]
  - And finally, do  a rbind to stack the test and train into one big table

```r
 dim(allData)
 [1] 10299  
  68  (66 mean/std columns + Subject + Activity)
```

Now, it is ready for the final Tidy dataset
### Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
```r
tidyResult     <-dataTable[,lapply(.SD, mean),by="Activity,Subject"]
```

## The Tidy Data Set
```r
names(tidyResult)
 [1] "Activity"
